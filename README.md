# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Isolation Forest and Random Forest


# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using **machine learning**. Initially, I implemented **Isolation Forest**, but due to suboptimal performance, I improved the model by using **Random Forest**, which significantly enhanced fraud detection accuracy.

## 📌 Overview
- **Isolation Forest** (Anomaly Detection) → ❌ Did not perform well.
- **Random Forest** (Classification) → ✅ Achieved better results.
- **SMOTE** used to handle **imbalanced data**.
- Evaluated models using the **Classification Report**.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy)
- Machine Learning: **Isolation Forest, Random Forest**
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Syedwasi996/CreditCard-Fraud-Detection.git
